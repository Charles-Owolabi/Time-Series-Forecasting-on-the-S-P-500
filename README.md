**Objective:** Build an LSTM forecasting model for S&P 500 index prices to inform profitable trading decisions.

Using a real-world S&P 500 dataset from Yahoo Finance, I built a LSTM model with a convolutional layer in Python. I to prepared time series data, created time windowing features, and reshape data for modeling.

The project covers constructing, training, and optimizing a forecasting model, as well as evaluating its performance using metrics like R-squared. l also visualized predictions against the true index values.
